### How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?

I saw it can be done by react equevalent framework and so I went with vue. The reason I choose vue is as below:

- Time frame. Base on previous experience Vue.js is genuinely quicker to develop.
- Project size & complexity. Base on experience Vue.js is a better fit for smaller & less complex projects. Choosing react for small & simple project like this would be overkill.
- personal preference. Vue.js has an excellent programming style and pattern.
Therefore, I conclude that Vue.js was a better fit than React for this project.

### Are there any improvements you could make to your submission? What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?

- Definitely I would
- Add in Vue Router to update the UI when the URL changes
- Add in unit testing
- Add in e2e testing (cypress)
